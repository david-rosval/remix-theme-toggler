# Remix Dark Mode with Cookies

This repository contains an implementation of dark mode in a Remix application, based on the tutorial by [Matt Stobbs](https://www.mattstobbs.com/remix-dark-mode-2024/). However, instead of manually handling cookies, this version leverages Remix's built-in modules for cookie management.

## Features
- Dark mode support with user preferences saved in cookies.
- Server-side and client-side handling of theme state.
- Uses Remix's `createCookie` and `getSession` utilities for cleaner cookie management.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
